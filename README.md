This project uses real survey data to discover what makes drivers accept/ reject location based coupons. 

Using the statistical summaries, probabilities, distributions and visualizations to compare customers patterns. we explore how factors like time of day, weather, passengers and coupon type like restaurants, takeout, bars influence the decisions. 

The goal is to identify the patterns,  compare acceptance rates and present the findings through clear visual insights. 

By comparing customers who took the deal with those who didnâ€™t we will highlight the factors that really making coupon acceptance.
